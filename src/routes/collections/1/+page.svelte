			Finally! After what felt like, forever, I'm proud to announce user5522.tk reached it's initial
			release, <strong>v1.0.0</strong>! <br />
			Website updates will now be weekly instead of daily (unless it's a critical bug) because, as much
			as I like web development, it is very tiring.<br />
			New collectionss will be available whenever I have something new (Collections can be about anything,
			even stuff outside of my projects' updates) & hopefully you enjoy your stay here.<br />
			<strong>Open-Source website??</strong><br />
			Yes, you heard it right, the source code for this website is just like all of my other projects',
			available
			<a href="/github" target="_blank">on my github profile.</a><br />
			It is mainly because I <A2764 class="inline-block h-6 w-6" /> Open-Source & to allow anyone who
			wants to improve my projects do so.<br />
			It's also to track bugs & issues easily. Reminder for anyone who encounters any problem to
			<a
				href="https://github.com/user5522/website/issues"
				id="issue-link"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noreferrer">make an issue on github</a
			>
			and report what's wrong. (a picture/video of the problem would be appreciated.)<br />
			<strong>What's the point of this place?</strong><br />
			This website is basically (& for now) a place for me to showcase my projects & collection about
			my thoughts. Think about it as a portfolio X collections website collab.<br />
			I'm plannig on adding more content, like simple html5 mini-games and some fun stuff like random
			cat images<br />
			<br />
			I would LOVE to know if you want me to add anything in this website, hit me by creating a

				href="https://github.com/user5522/website/issues"
