		<div class="${"text-xl"}">Finally! After what felt like, forever, I&#39;m proud to announce user5522.tk reached it&#39;s initial
			release, <strong>v1.0.0</strong>! <br>
			Website updates will now be weekly instead of daily (unless it&#39;s a critical bug) because, as much
			as I like web development, it is very tiring.<br>
			New collectionss will be available whenever I have something new (Collections can be about anything,
			even stuff outside of my projects&#39; updates) &amp; hopefully you enjoy your stay here.<br>
			<strong>Open-Source website??</strong><br>
			Yes, you heard it right, the source code for this website is just like all of my other projects&#39;,
			available
			<a href="${"/github"}" target="${"_blank"}">on my github profile.</a><br>
			It is mainly because I ${validate_component(A2764, "A2764").$$render($$result, { class: "inline-block h-6 w-6" }, {}, {})} Open-Source &amp; to allow anyone who
			wants to improve my projects do so.<br>
			It&#39;s also to track bugs &amp; issues easily. Reminder for anyone who encounters any problem to
			<a href="${"https://github.com/user5522/website/issues"}" id="${"issue-link"}" target="${"_blank"}" rel="${"noreferrer"}">make an issue on github</a>
			and report what&#39;s wrong. (a picture/video of the problem would be appreciated.)<br>
			<strong>What&#39;s the point of this place?</strong><br>
			This website is basically (&amp; for now) a place for me to showcase my projects &amp; collection about
			my thoughts. Think about it as a portfolio X collections website collab.<br>
			I&#39;m plannig on adding more content, like simple html5 mini-games and some fun stuff like random
			cat images<br>
			<br>
			I would LOVE to know if you want me to add anything in this website, hit me by creating a
			<a href="${"https://github.com/user5522/website/issues"}" id="${"issue-link"}" target="${"_blank"}" rel="${"noreferrer"}">github issue</a></div></div></div>`;
